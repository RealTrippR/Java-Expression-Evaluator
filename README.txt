This is a simplified version of a scientific calculator.
It evaluations equations, such as the one below:
((5*(2+5))+6)/2
and prints the result
(20.5)
As of now it only supports the current operations:

division
exponentiation


other functions, such as arc, sin, cos, and numerical constants such as pi, c, and e may be added in future versions.
